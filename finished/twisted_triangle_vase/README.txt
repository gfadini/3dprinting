# Summary

This is a 120 degree triangle twisted vase 5 inches tall and about 3.5 inches in diameter with a .05 inch wall thickness.

Printed in a XYZ Da Vinci 2.0 with 30% infill , I should have selected 15% or lower if any at all and a 200 micron resolution layer height. and no support material.

This part was saved at a very high STL resolution to get the smoothest lines available.

My rounded corner vase print failed because of a clogged extruder so it didn't complete a
full 120 degree twist. but I want to print another in the future .

This would be a very cool gift to give someone , or a very nice pen / pencil holder.
Please Share pictures if you printed this part out.
